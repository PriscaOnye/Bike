# The Net Ninja Tutorial Project 1

The Net Ninja HTML & CSS Tutorial Projects

While learning HTML and CSS I camp across the The Net Ninja tutorials on HTML & CSS which he posted on his YouTube Channel.

The First one was [CSS Tutorials For Beginners](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT). At the end I built a Bicycle webpage.
